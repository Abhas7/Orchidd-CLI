# Vanilla JS Todo App

A simple, yet production-ready Todo application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This app allows users to add, complete, delete, filter, and persist their todo items.

## Features

-   **Add Todos**: Quickly add new tasks to your list.
-   **Mark as Complete**: Toggle the completion status of a todo item.
-   **Delete Todos**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
-   **Filter Todos**: View all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks.
-   **Persist Data**: Todos are saved in your browser's local storage, so they remain even after closing and reopening the browser.
-   **Clear Actions**: Clear all completed tasks or clear all tasks entirely.
-   **Responsive Design**: Works well on various screen sizes.
-   **Input Validation**: Prevents adding empty todo items.
